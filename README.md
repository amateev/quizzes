# what to do after a development class

hey guys just got my internet back 

```
steps to take after today, do 1 or more each day

0. reach out to me about anything -> pavankat@gmail.com

	I'll be there for you, forever - that's a promise.

		coding error?

		interview prep?

		want me to pump you up?

		intro you to someone?

		question on machine learning/blockchain/ruby on rails/anything?

		want me to tell you how awesome you are?

1. make sure you can do each hw (without looking at the solution) in 6 to 10 hours (doesn't have to be in one sitting)

	if you can't then I would review the activities


2. open up an npm package and study the code, write down your questions, go over the code, add to your code snippets and flash cards

	- by doing this you'll grow leaps and bounds. You can start coding like the creators of express. I learned this from the Founder of Ruby On Rails in 2014 at railsconf in Chicago!

3. start reading a coding book, 
	
	railstutorial.com is the best book out there for web development. It teaches ruby on rails but also all the theory and thought behind things. you'll build a twitter clone while going through the book, and you'll even write tests for your code.



4. keep coding
	
	devpost 
		- hackathon listings
		- pair up and go together

	things that can help when you're doing it on your own (or you could set up a weekly google hangout and do a new video together each week - please do this!	)

	* https://www.pramp.com - schedule mock interviews with other people interviewing

	* http://kellymersereau.com/
		* a student of mine that got a job with this portfolio
	
	* if you want to model your resume off someone, model it off of kelly's
